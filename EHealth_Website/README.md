## 📋 Overview

**EHealth** is a full-featured digital healthcare management system designed to streamline hospital operations — from patient reception and doctor consultations to pharmacy dispensing and administrative oversight.

The platform supports **4 distinct user roles**, each with a tailored dashboard and specialized workflows:

| Role | Portal | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 🛡️ **Admin** | `/admin` | System configuration, user management, RBAC, analytics |
| 🩺 **Doctor** | `/portal/doctor` | Patient queue, examination, diagnosis (ICD-10), prescriptions |
| 💊 **Pharmacist** | `/portal/pharmacist` | Prescription dispensing, inventory management, stock alerts |
| 🏥 **Receptionist** | `/portal/receptionist` | Appointment scheduling, patient registration, billing |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v22.x (required — see setup below)
- **npm** ≥ 11.x
- **nvm** ([Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) — recommended for managing Node versions

> **⚠️ Important:** This project requires **Node.js v22.x** and **npm ≥ 11**. Using a different version may cause build errors. The repository includes a `.nvmrc` file and an `engines` field in `package.json` to enforce this.

#### Installing the correct Node.js version

**Option 1 — Using nvm (recommended):**

```bash
# Install Node.js v22 (one-time setup)
nvm install 22

# Switch to the project's required version (reads .nvmrc automatically)
nvm use
```

**Option 2 — Manual installation:**

Download and install Node.js v22.x from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/minhquan2504/EHealth_Website.git
cd EHealth_Website

# 2. Activate the correct Node.js version (if using nvm)
nvm use

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# 5. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — you'll be redirected to the login page.

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Create production build |
| `npm run start` | Serve production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint checks |

### Design Principles

- **Constants-Driven** — Zero hard-coded strings for routes, roles, statuses, colors, or API endpoints. Everything lives in `src/constants/`
- **Feature-Based Modules** — Each domain (users, appointments, prescriptions) encapsulates its own components and types
- **Service Layer Pattern** — All API calls are abstracted into service files under `src/services/`
- **Layout Composition** — Each role has its own layout with dedicated sidebar and header components
